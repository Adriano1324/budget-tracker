# Budget Tracker Monorepo
This monorepo contains a budget tracker application that allows users to efficiently manage their finances.
The application is divided into two main components: the backend, responsible for handling data storage and business logic, and the frontend, providing a user-friendly interface to interact with the budget tracker system.

## CI/CD

### Buildkite

## Backend
The backend of the application is built using FastAPI. It utilizes Neo4j as the database management system for storing budget-related data. 
Additionally, the backend implements GraphQL for flexible and powerful querying of the budget data.

### Technologies Used BE
- FastAPI
- Neo4j
    - neomodel
- GraphQL
    - strawberry-graphql

## Frontend
The frontend component is developed using Next.js. Apollo Client is used to interact with the GraphQL API provided by the backend, facilitating data fetching and management on the client side.

### Technologies Used FE
- Next.js
- Apollo Client
- Setup Instructions:


## Running project
Described in each module


### Running Backend

```sh
docker compose up web
```

## Monorepo Structure
This monorepo follows a structured approach to manage both the backend and frontend components within a single repository.
Each component resides in its respective directory (backend and frontend), allowing for independent development and testing while sharing common resources and configurations.
